        <p>
            I know you are real because I saw your shadow on the synthetic marble wall in the museum.
            You are right there, nothing has changed.<br>
            <br>
            Your wounds fresh as new every time I see you, they never heal or rot. It aches me, once again.<br>
            <br>
            My heart still trembled when I see you. I feel a strange kind of comfort and a rush of ecstasy for 
            realizing there are still things like you in this world, things beyond me and my tangling thoughts. 
            Things like you leave me in awe every time, I feel as frightened as a child again, 
            when my world was still full of enchantment and luring bunny snares.<br>
            <br>
            I realize that I haven’t grown numb yet, that I’m still alive. It’s like checking my pulse with you.<br>
            <br>
            I came here with the hope that you could show me, with your flesh and bones, that I can still feel something, 
            that things can hurt me, and I can still feel pain. It’s selfish, but truth to be told, this makes me happy, 
            even just for a moment.<br>
            <br>
            Things in life rarely aches me now… but your death feels different. Most things only bother me, but they don’t hurt. 
            They are becoming more and more like illusions, like a scratch on the skin. I guess I have lost touch with reality again.<br>
            <br>
            You look like a specimen of time. Only when looking close into death does reality burn my skin, giving life to extreme love and beauty.<br>
            <br>
            No matter how great and golden I imagine something to be, when reality rushes in, the grand palace in my mind collapse into ashes.<br>
            <br>
            People can be okay with anything, as long as it’s not real, as long as it doesn’t happen to them, as long as they weren’t there.<br>
            <br>
            But beyond all of this, beyond our mind, information, beyond knowing, beyond data, beyond control, <br>
            <br>
            do we truly have the courage to gaze into the eyes of death?
